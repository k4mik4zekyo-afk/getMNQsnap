# Agent Instructions

## Setup
Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`

## Primary Script
The main and only meaningful script in this repository is:

- get_snapshots.py

This file is the primary target for all modifications, bug fixes, and feature changes.

## Scope
- Focus exclusively on `get_snapshots.py`
- Treat all other files as placeholder or dummy code

## Restrictions
- Do NOT refactor, clean up, or modify other files
- Do NOT infer functionality from other files
- Do NOT move logic out of `get_snapshots.py`

## Assumptions
- Other files exist only to support testing or structure
- Any required changes should be implemented directly in `get_snapshots.py`

## Clarification Rule
If a requested change appears to require modifying files other than `get_snapshots.py`,
ask for confirmation before proceeding.
